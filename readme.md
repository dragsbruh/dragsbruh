# hey, i’m vro

👨‍💻 dev, student.

i mostly write in **typescript (on bun)**, **zig**, **go**, and **python**,  
because i like my tools fast, clean, and simple.  
_i use arch, btw._

## 🚧 current projects

- building a **web framework**, and **markov chains**
- rewriting finished projects for no good reason (because i can)
- making stuff related to performance, systems, or just vibes
