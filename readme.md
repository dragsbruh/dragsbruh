# hey, i’m vro

👨‍💻 dev, student.

i mostly write in **typescript (on bun)**, **zig**, **go**, and **python**,  
because i like my tools fast, clean, and simple.  
_i use arch, btw._

---

## 🚧 current projects

- building a **web framework**, a **public chat app**, and some **markov chain weirdness**
- rewriting finished projects for no good reason (because i can)
- making cursed-but-interesting stuff related to performance, systems, or just vibes

---

## 👀 catch me doing things like

- 🚫 refusing to use docker (💖 podman supremacy)
- 🔨 building tools nobody asked for
- 🧠 writing stuff from scratch when there’s a perfectly fine library i could've used
- 🧪 experimenting with stuff only i will use
